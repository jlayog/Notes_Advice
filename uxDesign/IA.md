## What is Information Architecture?

Information Architecture is the process of organizing and structuring the elements,describing them clearly and making ways for people to meet their needs effectively. It can be used in websites, intranet as well as in our daily life where we need to organize content in a more structured way. The main goal of well-informed architecture is to help users to complete tasks and goals more effectively and efficiently.

## 3 things needed to create good IA
1. ### People
- How they think, what they know and what they need to know, how they use the information and what is their terminology.
User research is important for understanding the requirement of people. Having knowledge of your target audience and empathizing with them will help you to group content in a way that makes sense to them and find them easily. Planning for user research involves figuring out the stakeholders who to research, how much to research and what you want to learn from the user, surveys.
Common research methods include user interviews, card sorting, observations, and data.
2. ### Content
- What you have, what you should have and what you need. A good understanding of content helps in making design scalable and maintaining it across iterations.
Sitemaps are one of the ways to organize the content. It is the hierarchical diagram showing the structure of a website or application to define the taxonomy through the grouping of related content. They are an important step of the user-centered process to define the breadth and depth of the content and ensure content is in place users would expect to find it.
3. ### Context
- What are the constraints and who else will be involved. This requires the understanding of both the target audience and the business.

## LATCH 
- ### Location

To organize information based on the location you need to think in terms of geography and topology. Let us consider the example of food ordering products and imagine you are trying to order the food and it shows the restaurants from the entire city.
Instead, they use the location and display relevant restaurants that must deliver in that area.
The same goes for cab booking apps.

- ### Alphabet

Arranging information alphabetically is the most significant and accessible way of organizing the information as it eases the process of content scanning. However, we should ensure the labels are the actual mental models that people use.
Consider an example of E-commerce products where the user sees all the available brands of shoes and the brands are arranged alphabetically.

- ### Time

This requires thinking about the temporal nature of the information and arranging it chronologically. It is mostly used in social media products ie Facebook, Linkedin for displaying posts or notifications.

- ### Category

It is the technique of arranging information in meaningful clusters and groups. As with all of these organizational schemes, itâ€™s clearly important to identify the categories that make the most sense to your users. Myntra, amazon uses categories to look for the right product easily.

- ### Hierarchy

Hierarchy refers to arranging information by any order, such as size, cost (Low to High OR High to Low), popularity, etc.
