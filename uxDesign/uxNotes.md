# Questions to ask when creating UX from

## Psychology 
- What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?
- How does this make them feel?
- How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
- What habits are created if they do this over and over?
- What do they expect when they click this?
- Are you assuming they know something that they haven’t learned yet?
- Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?
- Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?
- How are you rewarding good behaviour?

## Usability 
- Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
- Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)
- Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
- Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
- Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?
- Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
- Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?
- Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you know?
- If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?

## Design
- Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
- Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
- Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
- Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
- Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?
- Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?

## Copywriting
There is a huge difference between writing brand copy (text) and writing UX copy. Brand copy supports the image of the company. UX copy gets shit done as directly and simply as possible. Ask yourself:

- Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
- Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
- Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
- Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?
- Does it reduce anxiety?
- Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

## Analysis
- Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
- Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
- Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
- Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
- Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements?
- How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
- Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
- How can you use this analysis to make improvements?

## Research 
Some examples of subjective research:

**Interviews** — Get somebody and ask them a set of questions, one-by-one.

**Observation** — Give people tasks or instructions and watch them use your design, without help. Afterward, you can ask them questions.

**Focus Groups** — Get a bunch of people in a room together and ask them to discuss your questions.Note: Confident people often persuade others in the group, and a few random people are an unreliable example of anything, which is why I would rather set myself on fire than do a focus group in real life.

**Surveys** — A form, which people answer on paper or online. These can genuinely feel anonymous, which is useful.

**Card-Sorting** — Each person gets a set of ideas or categories (on cards or post-its), which they sort into groups that make sense. After many people have done this it gives you an idea of how your menu should look. ProTip: don’t use your colleagues for this. Use normal users.

**Google** — It’s amazing how many useful opinions you can find online, for free, right now.

### Important:

- Ask the same questions, the same way, to everyone.
- Avoid interpreting questions or suggesting answers.
- People might lie to avoid embarrassment or if it seems like you prefer a particular answer.
- Take notes or record the interview. Do not rely on your memory, ever.

## User Profiles
**So what is a persona / user profile?**

It describes the goals, expectations, motivations, and behaviour of real people. Why do they come to your site? What are they looking for? What makes them nervous? And so on.

All the information you need should be in your research and data. If you can’t back it up with research or data, you’re just making shit up and you should stop.

**Bad Profile**: Persona A is a female, between the ages of 35-45 with an above average income and education. They have at least one child and own at least one new vehicle. They are outgoing and career-oriented, and tend to be right-brain thinkers.

**Why it’s bad**: That might be great if you’re selling ads, but as far as UX goes, that profile is basically useless. Why? Because it doesn’t allow you to say “no” to any feature ideas. What sort of features does a female between 35-45 need? It could be anything!

**Useful Profile:** Persona A is an experienced manager, mostly interested in one or two areas of expertise. They visit often, but they are pressed for time, so they focus on “collecting” content to read on the weekends. They tend to be prolific social media sharers, mostly to Twitter and LinkedIn. They consider themselves thought-leaders, so public image is important.

**Why it’s useful:** Now you have a lot of information to use! You know that fluffy content will not be popular, self-curating will be a big deal and you have a basis for setting up content categories. They need easy access to sharing, and only certain types of social sharing will be relevant.

You also get to say “no” to a Facebook campaign, because these users don’t spend time there, and digest emails will be better than frequent notifications because these people are already pressed for time.
