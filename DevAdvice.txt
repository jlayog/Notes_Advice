#'Wiggling'
It being the process of debugging shit, moving things around, printing random data through console to assert values and flow, etc.

"The only time I would say you need to be careful wiggling things is if you're ever put in a position where you're working on a live site/app. this shouldn't ever happen, but it's happened to me while freelancing so I know the scenario exists
if you wiggle too many things you can, and probably will, break things, which is usually how you figure things out but on a live site could be bad news" -Are



#Cover Letters
"In my experience, cover letters need to be customized to the opportunity for the most part. By that I mean, you will always have some sort of "normal" section to it that explains a little about who you are and why you're awesome, but the meat of the letter should reference why you would be awesome to that company, and what you have seen/done/been exposed to that fits with their needs.
Make the entire thing professional, but in a conversational tone." -Are

the big takeaways that I think are important:
- give a fuck about the company. You should know what they do. I looked up videos, articles, and where possible, linked in accounts
- personalize them. If they mention a specific tech or characteristic that you can write about and emphasize on, do it
- don't worry about length. I just write a lot
- don't worry about instagram. I just wanted to be able to show people who I am outside of work, but to also be able to say that I put my instagram account in job applications
