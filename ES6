#Differences between var and let Keywords
With 'var', you may accidentally overrite a variable that you did not intend to overrite. 
To solve this, 'let' was introduced to help with the 'var' keyword. 
An error will appear if you try to code the same variables with the 'let' keyword.
Ex:

let camper = 'James';
let camper = 'David'; // throws an error

So unlike var, when using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
Note the "use strict". This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.
Ex:

"use strict";
x = 3.14; // throws an error because x is not declared

Full code ex:

let catName = "Oliver";
let quote;
function catTalk() {
  "use strict";

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!";

}
catTalk();


##Scopes of var and let
When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. 
When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, 
its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
Ex:

var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
// returns [0, 1, 2]
console.log(i);
// returns 3

With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable.
This code is similar to the following:

var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
// returns [0, 1, 2]
console.log(i);
// returns 3

This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop 
that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of 
the updated global i variable.

var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if(i === 2){
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
// returns 3

As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to i was updated and the 
printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i had when the function was created in the for loop. 
The let keyword does not follow this behavior:

'use strict';
let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
// returns 2
console.log(i);
// returns "i is not defined"

i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. 
printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) 
were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.

Exercise code:

function checkScope() {
"use strict";
  let i = "function scope";
  if (true) {
    i = "block scope";
    console.log("Block scope i is: ", i);
  }
  console.log("Function scope i is: ", i);
  return "function scope";
}


##Read-only variable with const Keyword
let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. 
They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.

"use strict"
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs"; // returns error

As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with const will throw an error. You should always name variables you 
don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant 
to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an 
underscore.

Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. 
Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.

function printManyTimes(str) {
  "use strict";

  const SENTENCE = str + " is cool!";
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i+=2) {
    console.log(SENTENCE);
  }

}
printManyTimes("freeCodeCamp");


#Mutate an Array Declared with const
The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the 
value. Only in that case, they use let.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are 
still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]

As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 
45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier 
s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

Ex:
const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  "use strict";

s[2] = 7;
s[0] = 2;
s[1] = 5;

}
editInPlace();


#Prevent object mutation with Object.freeze
Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object 
will be rejected without an error.
Ex:

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; //will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj); 
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}

Ex2:

function freezeObj() {
  "use strict";
  const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };

Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch( ex ) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();


#Arrow functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another 
function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere 
else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow 
function syntax:

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well 
as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

const myFunc = () => "value"

This code will still return value by default.
Ex:

const magic = () => {
  "use strict";
  return new Date();
};


##Write Arrow functions with Parameters
Just like a normal function, you can pass arguments into arrow functions.

// doubles input value and returns it
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;

You can pass more than one argument into arrow functions as well.
Ex:
Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.

const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => {
  "use strict";
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
};
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));


##Write higher order arrow functions
Arrow functions work really well with higher order functions, such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), that take other 
functions as arguments for processing collections of data.

Read the following code:
FBPosts.filter(function(post) {
  return post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500;
})

We have written this with filter() to at least make it somewhat readable. Now compare it to the following code which uses 
arrow function syntax instead:

FBPosts.filter((post) => post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500)

This code is more succinct and accomplishes the same task with fewer lines of code.
Ex:
Use arrow function syntax to compute the square of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) in the array 
realNumberArray and store the new array in the variable squaredIntegers.

- squaredIntegers should be a constant variable (by using const).
- squaredIntegers should be an array
- squaredIntegers should be [16, 1764, 36]
- function keyword was not used.
- loop should not be used
- map, filter, or reduce should be used

const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2];
const squareList = (arr) => {
  "use strict";
  // code below this line
  const squaredIntegers = arr.filter((num) => num > 0 && num % parseInt(num) === 0).map((num) => Math.pow(num, 2) );
  // code above this line
  return squaredIntegers;
};
// test your code
const squaredIntegers = squareList(realNumberArray);
console.log(squaredIntegers);


#Set default parameters for your functions
In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces default parameters for functions.

Check out this code:

function greeting(name = "Anonymous") {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
console.log(greeting("John")); // Hello John
console.log(greeting()); // Hello Anonymous

The default parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified (it is undefined). As you can see in the example above, the 
parameter name will receive its default value "Anonymous" when you do not provide a value for the parameter. You can add 
default values for as many parameters as you want.
Ex:

const increment = (() => {
  "use strict";
  return function increment(number, value = 1) {
    return number + value;
  };
})();
console.log(increment(5, 2)); // returns 7
console.log(increment(5)); // returns 6


##Rest Operators with Function Parameters
In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest operator for function parameters. With the rest 
operator, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can 
be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:

function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2)); // You have passed 3 arguments
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { })); // You have passed 4 arguments.

The rest operator eliminates the need to check the args array and allows us to apply map(), filter() and reduce() on the 
parameters array.
Ex:

This code

const product = (function() {
	"use strict";
	return function product(n1, n2, n3) {
		const args = [n1, n2, n3];
		return args.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1);
	};
})();
console.log(product(2, 4, 6));//48

Can be written as such

const product = (function() {
	"use strict";
	return function product(...n) {		
		return n.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1);
	};
})();
console.log(product(2, 4, 6));//48

Ex2:
Modify the function sum so that it uses the rest operator and it works in the same way with any number of parameters.

const sum = (function() {
  "use strict";
  return function sum(x, y, z) {
    const args = [ x, y, z ];
    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  };
})();
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6

Solution:

const sum = (function() {
  "use strict";
  return function sum(...args) {
    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  };
})();
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6


##Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple 
parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses apply() to compute the maximum value in an array:

var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr); // returns 89

We had to use Math.max.apply(null, arr) because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but 
not an array.

The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.

const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr); // returns 89

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array.

However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. The following 
code will not work:

const spreaded = ...arr; // will throw a syntax error

The apply() method calls a function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).

Ex1:

let numbers = [-12, 160, 0, -3, 51];
let minNum = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(minNum);//-12

Ex2:

let numbers = [-12, 160, 0, -3, 51];
let minNum = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(minNum);//-12

Ex3:

let numbers = [-12, 160, 0, -3, 51];
let minNum = Math.min(...numbers);
console.log(minNum);//-12

Ex4:
Copy all contents of arr1 into another array arr2 using the spread operator.

const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
let arr2;
(function() {
  "use strict";
  arr2 = [...arr1]; // changed this line
})();
console.log(arr2);


#Destructuring Assignment to assign variables from objects
Destructuring assignment is special syntax for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object to variables.

Consider the following ES5 code:

var voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54 };
var x = voxel.x; // x = 3.6
var y = voxel.y; // y = 7.4
var z = voxel.z; // z = 6.54

Here's the same assignment statement with ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { x, y, z } = voxel; // x = 3.6, y = 7.4, z = 6.54

If instead you want to store the values of voxel.x into a, voxel.y into b, and voxel.z into c, you have that freedom as well.

const { x : a, y : b, z : c } = voxel // a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.54

You may read it as "get the field x and copy the value into a," and so on.
Ex:
Use destructuring to obtain the average temperature for tomorrow from the input object AVG_TEMPERATURES, and assign value 
with key tomorrow to tempOfTomorrow in line.

const AVG_TEMPERATURES = {
  today: 77.5,
  tomorrow: 79
};

function getTempOfTmrw(avgTemperatures) {
  "use strict";
  // changed code below this line
  const {tomorrow: tempOfTomorrow} = avgTemperatures; // changed this line
  // changed code above this line
  return tempOfTomorrow;
}

console.log(getTempOfTmrw(AVG_TEMPERATURES)); // should be 79

Ex2:

function getLength(str) {
  "use strict";
  // changed code below this line
  const { length : len } = str; // changed this
  // changed code above this line
  return len; // you must assign length to len in line
}

The solution is above. In “{ length : len } = str” we are saying copy the value from length property of the str for len.


##Destructuring to assign variables from nested objects
We can similarly destructure nested objects into variables.

Consider the following code:

const a = {
  start: { x: 5, y: 6},
  end: { x: 6, y: -9 }
};
const { start : { x: startX, y: startY }} = a;
console.log(startX, startY); // 5, 6

In the example above, the variable start is assigned the value of a.start, which is also an object.
Ex:

const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  today: { min: 72, max: 83 },
  tomorrow: { min: 73.3, max: 84.6 }
};

function getMaxOfTmrw(forecast) {
  "use strict";
  // changed code below this line
  const { tomorrow : { max: maxOfTomorrow}} = forecast; // changed this line
  // changed code above this line
  return maxOfTomorrow;
}

console.log(getMaxOfTmrw(LOCAL_FORECAST)); // should be 84.6


##Destructuring to assign variables from Arrays
ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.

One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an 
array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:

const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2

The variable a is assigned the first value of the array, and b is assigned the second value of the array.

We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:

const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c); // 1, 2, 5

Ex1:
Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value 
stored in a.

let a = 8, b = 6;
(() => {
  "use strict";
  // changed code below this line
  [b, a] = [a, b];
  // changed code above this line
})();
console.log(a); // should be 6
console.log(b); // should be 8

const [b, a] = [a,b] will result in the value of a,b as undefined(simple assignment rule left to right).

Hence the solution to this problem is [b, a] = [a, b]


#Destructuring Assignment with Rest operator to reassign Array elements
In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.

The result is similar to Array.prototype.slice(), as shown below:

const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
console.log(arr); // [3, 4, 5, 7]

Variables a and b take the first and second values from the array. After that, because of rest operator's presence, arr gets 
rest of the values in the form of an array.

The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list. As in, you cannot use the rest operator to catch a 
subarray that leaves out last element of the original array.
Ex:
Use destructuring assignment with the rest operator to perform an effective Array.prototype.slice() so that arr is a sub-
array of the original array source with the first two elements omitted.

const source = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  "use strict";
  // changed code below this line
  const [source, removedTwo, ...arr] = list; // changed this
  // changed code above this line
  return arr;
}
const arr = removeFirstTwo(source);
console.log(arr); // should be [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
console.log(source); // should be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];


##Destructuring Assignment to pass an object as a function's parameters
In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  /* do something with these fields */
}
This removes some extra lines and makes our code look neat.

This has the added benefit of not having to manipulate an entire object in a function; only the fields that are needed are 
copied inside the function.
Ex:
Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function [half] to send only [max] and [min] inside the function.
