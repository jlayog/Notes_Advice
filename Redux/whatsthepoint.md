# What is the point in writing code with reducers, action, state, and store?

**Redux is one of the best libraries for scaling an application to be very large with the least amount of code complexity.**   
As your apps start to grow and get more features, Redux will help you write code so that your code doesn't have to grow in complexity.

# How?
**Action system.**    
The whole process of dispatching an action and receiving inside the reducer, actions give the ability to make predictable changes to the state of our application. It means that we can only modify our application state in a finite number of ways.
