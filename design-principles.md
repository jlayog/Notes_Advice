# Design Principles

## C.R.A.P.

### Contrast
Strong contrast allows the user toe asily differentiate between elements. Creates a flow and gives more meaning to design.

### Repetition
A consistency in elements & style throughout your design creates a cohesive feel, and can help guide the user throughout your website.

### Alignment
Creates a clear relationship between elements. Nothing should feel out of place, unless it is intentional

### Proximity
Creates a clear relationship between elements as well. Grouped elements are related. Separate elements are not related.

# Design Jargon

## Mood Board
A collage composed of colours, pictures, samples of objects, textures, screenshots, etc. to convey a mood or direction of a design or brand.

Popular with graphic & web designers when presenting ideas, or a direction they would like to go with a project.

## Wireframe
A sketch, or series of sketches, on paper or screen that serves as a blueprint for a website layout. 
They are effective because they are quick to produce, focus on optimizing functionality, layout, and content organization without letting colors & style get in the way.

Pros: Easiest and best way to get ideas out in the open.
Cons: If there is no budget, it may not be the best use of your time. Not appealing to a client.

## Rough
First draft of a layout, after sketching is complete. It's called a rough, because the first draft is often not directly "on the mark" and needs much work before the design is perfect.

## Comp
Second draft of a layout or design, once the roughs have been approved.

## Mockup
An official, final draft of a web design. This is usually done in software like Adobe Photoshop, or sketch.
