# Design Principles

## C.R.A.P.

### Contrast
Strong contrast allows the user toe asily differentiate between elements. Creates a flow and gives more meaning to design.

### Repetition
A consistency in elements & style throughout your design creates a cohesive feel, and can help guide the user throughout your website.

### Alignment
Creates a clear relationship between elements. Nothing should feel out of place, unless it is intentional

### Proximity
Creates a clear relationship between elements as well. Grouped elements are related. Separate elements are not related.
