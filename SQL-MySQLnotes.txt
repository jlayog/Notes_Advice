#SQL Structed Query Language and MySQL

#SQL is a domain-specific query language(a language for the specification of procedures for the retrieval (and sometimes also modification) of information from a database) used in programming and designed for updating, deleting, and requesting information from databases.

Purpose: To query and operate database system.

In a distributed database system, a program often referred to as the database's "back end" runs constantly 
on a server, interpreting data files on the server as a standard relational database. Programs on client 
computers allow users to manipulate that data, using tables, columns, rows, and fields. To do this, client 
programs send SQL statements to the server. The server then processes these statements and returns result 
sets to the client program.

Differences in SQL and MySQL
--MYSQL available for free since it is open source, But SQL is not open source.

--MYSQL offers only updateable views, SQL offers indexed views which are much more powerful, performing wise.

--MYSQL doesn't support XML, Where as XML supports it.

--Auto tuning is not supported in MYQL, But can in SQL.

--User defined functions are not supported in MYSQL, But supported in SQL.

--Transaction support is very much limited in MYSQL, But extensively and fully offered in SQL.

--Stored procedures and full joins not offered in MYSQL, But offered in SQL.

To give a better idea of the differences in MySQL and SQL Server -MySQL is geared more toward selecting data so it can be displayed, updated and saved again. MySQL is weaker in the areas of inserting and deleting data. 

#MySQL
is an RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) that allows keeping the data that exists in a database organized. This RDBMS system is used with the combination of PHP and Apache Web Server, on top of a Linux distribution. MySQL uses the SQL language to query the database. Used to store, retrieve, modify and administrate a database using SQL.
MySQL is database software. It used "SQL" language to query the database.

Purpose: Allows data handling, storing, modifying, deleting in a tabular format.
