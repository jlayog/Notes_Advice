<h2 align="center">Setting up Oracle Virtual Box with Windows</h2>

<p>This is a personal guide to setting up a VM, port security, for easily discardable development environments.</p>

### What resources you will need to install:

- [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    - Personally, this is what I was taught with, so it is what we will be using.
    - **NOTE:** Make sure that you have Hyper-V disabled, otherwise the VM will not load upon boot. Not always the case, but it happens.
- [Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/#download)
    - LTS due to some incompatibility and some bugs in the latest version.
